The source for the story was a poll that asked people, \"Irrespective of whether you attend a place of worship or not, would you say you are a religious person, not a religious person or a convinced atheist?\" This type of question, which asks people to classify themselves in one way or another, is common in polling and generates categorical data. In this lab we take a look at the atheism survey and explore what's at play when making inference about population proportions using categorical data."

    "- The margin of error is at its minimum when the proportion is totally skewed one way or another. However, as it approaches equality from left or right, it approaches its maximum, which is about 0.030 when p = 0.5. The reason for this trend might be because as the proportion increases, the number of proportion intervals increases as well, and thus, increasing the margin of error."

    "Next, we will look at behaviorial survey data. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual telephone survey of 350,000 people in the United States collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As its name implies, the BRFSS is designed to identify risk factors in the adult population and report emerging health trends. For example, respondents are asked about their diet and weekly physical activity, their HIV/AIDS status, possible tobacco use, and even their level of healthcare coverage. The [BRFSS Web site](https://www.openintro.org/redirect.php?go=cdc_data_brfss&referrer=data_set_page) contains a complete description of the survey, the questions that were asked and even research results that have been derived from the data.\n",
